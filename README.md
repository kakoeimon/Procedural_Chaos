Procedural Chaos

A dual stick shooter.

Each Egg you break will create two Infants, Infants will grow to become Berserkers and Berserkers will grow and become Copters.
Each enemy you destroy (Infants, Berserkers, Copters) will spawn a Spore. If a Spore touches an Egg, becomes an Infant and breaks the Egg.
Infants touching with Besrserkers become Berserkers
Infants touching a Spore will become Berserkers.
If you shoot a Spore it will become a your Spore and you can drag it to yourself by shooting it, if you touch your Spores they become your Eggs.
If two Spores collides then they become an Egg.
If the you shoot an Egg of yours then those Eggs shoot too.
Berserkers shoot at you when they are created and when they collide with the edges of the stage. They die if they collide with your Eggs and they break your Egg. They are trying to accelerate towards you.
Copters destroy Eggs. They break their Eggs and yours without dieing. They keep a direction and speed and bounce.
